Program to read animation frames from 2mbps USB-to-serial and transmit them wirelessly to the POV fan controller using the nRF24L01+ wireless device.

Runs on Tiva TM4C Cortex-M4 microcontroller.

Send packets back-to-back, to maximise the throughput (without
retransmit, so unreliable transfer similar to UDP).
Able to get around 195 kbyte/second of payload data throughput.

Protocol description:

Data is sent from pov_sender to the POV control board over nRF24L01+ in 32-byte packets.
The first byte T identifies the kind of packet.

If the value is 0 <= T <= 204, then the packet contains frame buffer data. The remaning 31 bytes are data to be loaded into the frame buffer, at offset (T*31).

If the value is T=255, then it is a command packet. Format of this to be determined.

If the value is T=254, then it is a debug packet. This is used to program the
flash on the POV control board, over wireless. The second byte U is a sub-type
for debug packet:

  0 <= U <= 34  The remainder of the packet is data to be loaded into a
                1024-byte flash buffer at offset U*30. There is no U=240
                status reply for this packet.

  U = 240       Bootloader status; this packet is sent from bootloader to
                pov_sender as a reply as noted for specific commands; for
                these commands the pov_sender must switch to receive mode and
                wait for the reply. The third byte of this packet is either
                zero for ok or else an error code.

  U = 252       Flash. This instructs the bootloader to write the contents of
                the 1024-byte flash buffer to flash. The destination is
                identified with a block number stored in the following 4
                bytes, little-endian; the address written starts at
                1024*blocknum. The bootloader sends a U=240 status reply when
                done.

  U = 253       Reset; the bootloader sends a U=240 status reply and transfers
                control to the target application.

  U = 254       Enter bootloader. If the bootloader receives this within 1
                second of reset, it replies with a T=254,U=240 packet and
                remains in bootloader mode for more commands; else it starts
                the POV application after 1 second.

  U = 255       Reset the control board and enter the bootloader.

Communication over USB.

The pov_sender emulates a /dev/ttyACM0 USB-to-serial adapter. Packet data is
sent via this device, and status information is read back.

Data is sent as raw bytes, 32 for each packet. Synchronisation is time-based;
if no data is received within 0.2 seconds, then the connection is reset, and
any later data is assumed to start a new packet.
