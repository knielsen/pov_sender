Program to read animation frames from 2mbps USB-to-serial and transmit them wirelessly to the POV fan controller using the nRF24L01+ wireless device.

Runs on Tiva TM4C Cortex-M4 microcontroller.

Send packets back-to-back, to maximise the throughput (without
retransmit, so unreliable transfer similar to UDP).
Able to get around 195 kbyte/second of payload data throughput.
